# Sidereal: Gameplay Overview

## Project Overview

Sidereal is a massively multiplayer 2D top-down action ARPG set in a vast and dynamic space universe. Players navigate this universe through a web browser, embarking on various adventures as they pilot customizable ships, establish space stations, engage in combat, trade resources, explore unknown regions, and interact with both NPCs and other players.

The game combines the depth of complex space simulation games with the accessibility of browser-based play, allowing for a rich gaming experience without requiring specialized hardware or software installation. The top-down 2D perspective offers clarity in tactical situations while still allowing for complex gameplay mechanics and visually engaging environments.

Sidereal aims to create a living, breathing universe where player actions have meaningful consequences, economies evolve based on supply and demand, factions rise and fall based on player allegiances, and unexplored regions offer adventure and opportunity for those brave enough to venture into them.

## Core Game Systems

### Ship & Station Construction

- **Grid-Based Hull System**: Ships and stations are constructed from a hull grid where components are placed
- **Directional Component Placement**:
  - Components are placed facing one of four directions (Port, Starboard, Fore, Aft)
  - Directional components function based on their orientation (e.g., thrusters push in the opposite direction they face)
  - Tactical placement of directional components creates unique ship capabilities
- **Dynamic Ship Stats**: All ship capabilities are emergent properties of installed components:
  - **Power Generation**: Reactors provide energy for all systems, with total ship power being the sum of all reactor outputs
  - **Shield Protection**: Shield generators create directional protection fields, with overlapping generators providing enhanced coverage
  - **Weapon Systems**: Weapon mounts have firing arcs and energy requirements based on placement and type
  - **Propulsion**: Thrusters generate force in the opposite direction they face, requiring balanced placement for optimal handling
  - **Mass Distribution**: Each component adds to the ship's total mass, affecting maneuverability and inertia
- **Advanced Physics Simulation**:
  - **Realistic Thruster Mechanics**: Ship movement depends on thruster placement and orientation
  - **Rotational Control**: Turning requires thrusters placed at appropriate positions to create torque
  - **Center of Mass**: Component placement affects the ship's center of mass, impacting handling characteristics
  - **Moment of Inertia**: Mass distribution determines how easily a ship rotates
  - **Realistic Vector Physics**: Ships follow Newtonian physics, with forces and torques calculated in real-time
  - **Rapier Physics Integration**: Physical properties are continuously updated and synchronized with the physics engine
- **Ship Handling Characteristics**:
  - **Thrust-to-Weight Ratio**: Heavier ships with fewer thrusters accelerate more slowly
  - **Rotational Agility**: Thrusters placed further from the center of mass provide more efficient rotation
  - **Lateral Movement**: Sideways thrusters enable strafing maneuvers
  - **Balanced Designs**: Well-balanced ships have symmetric thruster placement for predictable handling
  - **Specialized Designs**: Asymmetric thruster layouts can create ships with unique movement capabilities
- **Component Interactions**:
  - Power distribution systems determine which components receive energy when demand exceeds supply
  - Heat management requires proper component spacing and cooling systems
  - Damage to specific grid sections affects the components installed there
  - Energy-intensive components can cause power fluctuations during peak usage
  - Thruster failure can cause unbalanced flight characteristics and rotation
- **Hull Size Variety**: Multiple hull sizes determine the overall capacity for components
- **Component Types**:
  - Reactors (power generation with heat output)
  - Armor plating (directional protection)
  - Weapons (beam weapons, projectiles, missiles)
  - Shield generators (directional energy fields)
  - Tractor beams
  - Jump drives
  - Power distribution nodes
  - Cargo bays (affecting total capacity and access speed)
  - Hangar bays
  - Sensor arrays (with directional sensitivity)
  - Engines and thrusters (vectored thrust based on placement)
  - Life support systems
  - Electronic warfare modules
  - Cooling systems (heat management)
  - Resource harvesters
- **Thruster Types**:
  - **Main Engines**: High-powered but fixed direction, typically aft-facing for forward thrust
  - **Maneuvering Thrusters**: Lower power but essential for rotation and lateral movement
  - **Vectored Thrusters**: Can adjust thrust direction slightly for versatile movement
  - **Omnidirectional Thrusters**: Equal thrust in all directions but less efficient
- **Visual Customization**: Color schemes, decals, insignias, and ship naming
- **Ship Classes**: Hull templates optimized for specific roles (combat, mining, transport, etc.)
- **Component Variations**: Components with different stats, strengths, and weaknesses
- **Blueprint System**: Save and share ship designs with the community

#### Sample Ship Design (Work-in-Progress)

Below is a sample ship design using an 11x11 component grid, demonstrating how the various components can be placed to create a functional ship with balanced capabilities:

```
   0123456789A
  +-----------+
0 |....A^A^...|  SHIP DESIGN: "BALANCED CRUISER"
1 |..A^A^A^A^.|
2 |.A<WW^WW>A.|  C = Command Center
3 |TA<R>C<R>AT|  R = Reactor (500 power each)
4 |TA<R>C<R>AT|  W = Pulse Cannon (requires 300 power)
5 |TA<R>C<R>AT|  E = Main Engine (high forward thrust)
6 |TA<R>C<R>AT|  T = Maneuvering Thruster (rotation/lateral)
7 |.A<RR^RR>A.|  A = Armor Plating (directional protection)
8 |.A<WW^WW>A.|  S = Shield Generator
9 |..A<EE>A...|
A |....EEvv...|  Ship Properties:
  +-----------+  - Balanced thrust in all directions
                 - Strong forward firepower
                 - Symmetrical mass distribution
                 - Good rotational capability
```

This design illustrates several key concepts of the ship construction system:

- Central command center with components arranged around it
- Directional components (arrows indicate facing direction)
- Balanced thruster placement for good handling
- Symmetrical design for predictable flight characteristics
- Armor placement protecting vital systems
- Forward-facing weapons for optimal firing arcs

The symbols represent the direction each component is facing:

- `^` = Component facing Fore (forward)

- `<` = Component facing Port (left)
- `>` = Component facing Starboard (right)

- Inertia means ships continue moving without constant thrust
- Ships can rotate to change direction
- Velocity is maintained while changing orientation
- Component-based directional thrust system allows for customization

### Gravity and Celestial Movement

The game simulates gravity between celestial bodies and ships:

- Planets, stars, and large objects exert gravitational pull
- Ships and smaller objects are affected by gravity
- Orbital mechanics allow for realistic space movement
- N-body simulation for dynamic celestial interactions

### Collision and Interaction

The physics system handles various types of collisions:

- Ship-to-ship collisions can cause damage
- Ship-to-asteroid collisions for mining
- Projectile collisions for combat
- Docking with stations and larger ships
